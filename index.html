			</p>

			<h2><u>
				GUI:
			</u></h2>
			<p class = "text_box">
				The Graphical User Interface of JEEV is simple yet compact, the GUI is not fully shown to the player until they meet certain conditions, like being next to a working bench or having the appropriate tool in the inventrory.<br>
				The mini-UI elements like the inventory section or crafting section are not that hard to understand, even for someone who strugles to use the SBI website. All the information is hidden from the player inorder to give them a simple vibe.<br>
				This is achived through hidding specific information behind a button or option menu, so the player can view those complicated things if they want to or is comfortable playing with a cramped UI.<br>
			</p>
			
			<h2><u>
				Combat System:
			</u></h2>
			<p class = "text_box">
				The Combat System of JEEV is fairly simple, point to attack method(I think thats what its called). You simply point to  something that you want to attack or interact with and click(Left-mouse button on a desktop) or use a joy stick to control the pointer(on touch devices).<br>
				The fighting is very satisfing because killing someting wil not only drop loot but also leave a <b>corpse</b> for the player to interact with, the corpse will have some more items that wasn't droped from it. If the player gose on a spree on killing the corpses are combined togrther and a corpse pile is formed which won't give as much as loot from going through a corpse at a time because looking for items in a pile is hard and boring.<br>
			</p>
			
			<h2><u>
				Inventry System:
			</u></h2>
			<p class = "text_box">
				Ah, the good old inventry dialog. JEEV implements two types of inventry systems, a grid based one where you can see your items scrambeled every where , and a tree structured one.<br>
				This is because the grid based one is for the player who doesn't need much info for their current objective and the grid system helps to keep the immeresion from not going away.<br>
				And the tree based one is for the player who are in a specific need to get info on stuff, if it is to find out what they can make out of something or to know about what the item might do on specific situations.
			</p>
			
			<h2><u>
				About:
			</u></h2>
			<p class = "text_box">
				The game is made on <code>Godot Engine</code> with a 16x16 Pixel Art style.<br>
				The sound and music is simple because i'm not that great at music.<br>
				The UI is complex but it is not shown fully to the player but through various ingame mechanics to simplify user experience.
