				By GasSpace Games

			<p class = "text_box">
				JEEV is a <strong>free</strong> to play multiplatform game, with a big amount of stuff/activities for the player to do.<br>
				The game is an <strong>Top-Down 2D Survival RPG</strong> but also highly focusing on the <strong>crafting and gathering</strong> aspects.

			</a>
			<h2><u>
				GUI:
			</u></h2>
			<p class = "text_box">
				The Graphical User Interface of JEEV is simple yet compact, the GUI is not fully shown to the player until they are met with certain conditions, like being next to a working bench or having the appropriate tool or item in the inventrory.<br>
				The mini-UI elements like the inventory section or crafting section are not that hard to understand, for even to someone who strugles to use the SBI website. All the information is hidden from the player in order to give them a simple vibe.<br>
				This is achived through hidding specific information behind a button or option menu, so the player can view those complicated things if they want to or is comfortable playing with a cramped UI.<br>
			</p>
			
			<h2><u>
				Inventry System:
			</u></h2>
			<p class = "text_box">
				Ah, the good old inventry dialog. JEEV implements two types of inventry systems, a grid based one where you can see your items scrambeled every where , and a tree structured one.<br>
				This is because the grid based one is for the player who doesn't need much info for their current objective and the grid system helps to keep the immeresion from not going away.<br>
				And the tree based one is for the player who are in a specific need to get info on stuff, if it is to find out what they can make out of something or to know about what the item might do on specific situations.
			</p>
			
			<h2><u>
				Crafting System:
			</u></h2>
			<p class = "text_box">
				Crafting system in JEEV is not that complex at first, you can craft things from othem things by having the required items on your inventory.<br>
				But for crafting complex items like a sword from grass requires a work station ie, a table, bench etc... And you would need tools like sissors, screwdrivers, wrenches etc.. on the work station too. You need to add those tools to your work station to unlock or make certain items.<br>
				
			</p>
			
			<h2><u>
				Combat System:
			</u></h2>
			<p class = "text_box">
				The Combat System of JEEV is fairly simple, point to attack method(<em>I think thats what its called</em>). You simply point to  something that you want to attack or interact with and click(Left-mouse button on a desktop) or use a joy stick to control the pointer(on touch devices).<br>
				The fighting is very satisfing because killing someting wil not only drop loot but also leave a <b>corpse</b> for the player to interact with, the corpse will have some more items that wasn't droped from it. If the player gose on a spree on killing the corpses are combined togrther and a corpse pile is formed which won't give as much as loot from going through a corpse at a time because looking for items in a pile is hard and boring.<br>
			</p>
			
			<h2><u>
				Weapon/Tools:
			</u></h2>
			<p class = "text_box">
				<big><u><strong>
					Weapons:
				</strong></u></big>
				There is a wide range of weapons to from in JEEV, each weapon with their own characteristics. <u>Like tools weapons wont break if used too much. But they will deteriorate</u>, they will lose their effectivness that is, <strong>Weapons will lose some of its qualities like sharpness, grip etc...</strong> You can save your weapon from going bad by fixing/repairing it with specific items or upgrade it with special items to make it better than before.
				<br><br>
				<big><u><strong>
					Tools:
				</strong></u></big>
				Tools are used for making things that you can't make with your bare hands and to do activities that your bare hands can't do. Like weapons tools won't break but lose their qualities, which can be repaired and upgraded.
			</p>
			
			<h2><u>
				Effects System and Consumables:
			</u></h2>
			<p class = "text_box">
				In JEEV there is no hunger/thirst mechanic like some survival games, instead JEEV has <strong>Effects System</strong>. You can use comsumables to get a buff like increase speed,strength,range,etc... <br>
				Consuming consumable/items raw or unprocessed can give you a random side effect with the buff. You can avoid his by cooking or making potions with the consumable/food.<br><br>
				To get <strong>Permanent Effects</strong> you would need to accuire some kind of special item likely an Artifact, Apparel, etc... These efffects will be removed if the item is not in your inventry.
			</p>
			
			<h2><u>
				Farming System:
			</u></h2>
			<p class = "text_box">
				Farming is done to make specific <strong>Consumables</strong> for the player to buff their stats for a short period of time.<br>
				To start farming, first you need an empty plot of land where plants can grow. You can use this space for planting/growing your spling/seed. After a period of time the sapling/seed will grow an mature, then you can harvest it to get the consumable. (Typical farming in games).<br>
				You can speed up the process by using organic and inorganic fertilizers, this will not affect the product.
			</p>
			
			<h2><u>
				Apparel System:
			</u></h2>
			<p class = "text_box">
				The <strong>Apparel/dressing system</strong> in JEEV has a good role in the survival much like weapons. Some apparel may look good and some seem stupid, some may give you good protection and some may don't.<br>
				There is wide range of dressing option to choose from.
			</p>
			
			<h2><u>
				Ecomony:
			</u></h2>
			<p class = "text_box">
				In JEEV there are 3 types of currency; CC, SC, GC. Namelly CopperCoin, SilverCoin, GoldCoin.<br>
				These can be used to buy items from NPC's and other places where you can use money to get things done, and you can trade your items to get the coins as well.
			</p>
			
			<h2><u>
				About:
			</u></h2>
			<p class = "text_box">
				The game is made on <code>Godot Engine</code> with a 16x16 Pixel Art style.<br>
				The sound and music is simple because i'm not that great at music.<br>
				The UI is complex but it is not shown fully to the player but through various ingame mechanics to simplify user experience.
